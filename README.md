## Description

This is for the technical test for Finixio. This app uses Kea (Redux), axios and react-base-table.

I have chosen to use Kea (https://github.com/keajs/kea) as the state management utility for this app. Kea is a state management utility built on top of redux and is meant to reduce to amount of code needed to write actions and reducers. The reason I have gone with Kea is because it is simple to set-up and use and it provides the ability to use any of the store's data on any component and class in the app.
